  <h1>Aurelian</h1>


  <h3 id="Introduction">Introduction</h3>
  <p>Aurelian (Latin: Lucius Domitius Aurelianus; 9 September 214 – c. October 275) was a Roman emperor, who reigned
    during the Crisis of the Third Century, from 270 to 275. As emperor, he won an unprecedented series of military
    victories which reunited the Roman Empire after it had nearly disintegrated under the pressure of barbarian
    invasions and internal revolts.</p>

  <h3 id="earlyLife">Early Life</h3>
  <p>Many details about Aurelian's early life come from the Historia Augusta and are considered unreliable. Comparative
    research with other sources from his era has rendered some details more secure than others. The 6th-century
    chronicler John Malalas wrote that he died at the age of 61,[5] hence he was born in 214. Aurelian was born on 9
    September, a date recorded in the Chronograph of 354.[6]
    The Historia Augusta describes him both as a Pannonian from Sirmium and as a native of Dacia Ripensis "which he
    founded so that he would have been a Moesian". Pseudo-Victor and John Xiphilinus place his birthplace in an area
    between Dacia Ripensis and Macedonia (overlapping with Dacia Mediterranea). Modern research considers Dacia Ripensis
    as the more likely region. When he was born this region was part of Moesia Superior. Aurelian was an Illyrian like
    several other emperors of the late 3rd century (Illyrian emperors) all of whom shared a common military
    background.[7] Pseudo-Victor describes his father as a colonus (tenant farmer) who worked the lands of a senator
    named Aurelius. Aurelian's father was probably a veteran of the Roman army. He married the daughter of Aurelius from
    whom Aurelian received his name via his mother. The Historia Augusta describes her as "priestess of Sol", whose
    worship Aurelian promoted as Emperor (Sol Invictus).[8] These two propositions, together with the tradition that the
    clan Aurelius had been entrusted with the maintenance of that deity's cult in Rome, inspired the notion that this
    could explain the devotion to the sun-god that Aurelian was to manifest as emperor. However, it seems that this
    extrapolation of unverifiable facts is now generally accepted as being no more than just that</p>


  <h3 id="militaryService">Military Service</h3>
  <p>It is commonly accepted that Aurelian probably joined the army in 235 at around age twenty.[6] It is also generally
    assumed that, as a member of the lowest rank of society – albeit a citizen[b] – he would have enlisted in the ranks
    of the legions. Saunders suggests that his career is more easily understood if it is assumed that his family was of
    Roman settler origins with a tradition of military service and that he enlisted as an equestrian.[10] This would
    have opened up for him the tres militia – the three steps of the equestrian military career – one of the routes to
    higher equestrian office in the Imperial Service.[c] This could be a more expeditious route to senior military and
    procuratorial offices than that pursued by ex-rankers, although not necessarily less laborious.[d] However, although
    Saunders's conjecture as to Aurelian's early career is not supported by any evidence other than his nomen which
    could indicate Italian settler ancestry — and even this is contested — his rise to the highest ranks is more easily
    understood if he did not have to start from the bottom. His suggestion has not been taken up by other academic
    authorities.

    Whatever his origins, Aurelian certainly must have built up a very solid reputation for military competence during
    the tumultuous mid-decades of the century. To be sure, the exploits detailed in the Historia Augusta vita Divi
    Aureliani, while not always impossible, are not supported by any independent evidence and one at least is
    demonstrably an invention typical of that author.[11] However, he was probably associated with Gallienus's cavalry
    army and shone as an officer of that elite unit because, when he finally emerged in a historically reliable context
    in the early part of the reign of Claudius II, he seems to have been its commander</p>


  <h3 id="ulpiusCrinitus">Ulpius Crinitus</h3>
  <p>The existence of Ulpius Crinitus has been doubted by many historians.[13] If he did exist he would have been a dux
    of the Illyrian and Thracian legions.[14] Ulpius was reportedly born in the city of Italica, in modern Spain.[15] He
    took an interest in Aurelian's early career.[16] Aurelian was reportedly his deputy for a time. When a group of
    Goths invaded Illyria and Thrace, Ulpius had fallen ill, so he ordered Aurelian to deal with the invaders. Aurelian
    was designated as legate of the Third Legion. He used his force of 2,500 auxiliaries, and the armies of four
    Germanic chieftains to defeat the Goths in battle. Aurelian used the resources gained from the battles to enrich the
    provinces. After the battle, Crinitus thanked Valerian, the emperor at the time, for providing him with such a
    talented deputy.[13] Crinitus adopted Aurelian as his heir, either voluntarily or possibly through force.[17]
    Emperor Valerian attended the adoption ceremony which took place in the baths of Byzantium.[18] Following this,
    Crinitus disappeared from the historical record.[13][15] A painting showing Ulpius Crinitus alongside Aurelian has
    been found in the Temple of Sol, adding to the veracity of his existence</p>

  <h3 id="underGallienus">Under Gallienus</h3>
  <p>Aurelian's successes as a cavalry commander ultimately made him a member of Emperor Gallienus' entourage. In 268
    Gallienus travelled to Italy and fought Aureolus, his former general and now usurper for the throne. Driving
    Aureolus back into Mediolanum, Gallienus promptly besieged his adversary in the city. However, during the siege the
    Emperor was assassinated. One source says Aurelian, who was present at the siege, participated and supported general
    Claudius for the purple — which is plausible.[20] In 268 or 269 Aurelian and his cavalry participated in the victory
    of Emperor Gallienus (or Emperor Claudius II Gothicus) over the Goths at the Battle of Naissus.[21][22]

    Aurelian was married to Ulpia Severina, about whom little is known. She was from Dacia.[23] They are known to have
    had a daughter together.</p>


  <h3 id="underClaudius">Under Claudius</h3>
  <p>Claudius was proclaimed emperor by the soldiers outside Mediolanum. The new emperor immediately ordered the Senate
    to deify Gallienus. Next, Claudius began to distance himself from those responsible for his predecessor's
    assassination, ordering the execution of those directly involved.[25] Aureolus was still besieged in Mediolanum and
    sought reconciliation with the new emperor, but Claudius had no sympathy for a potential rival. The emperor had
    Aureolus killed and one source implicates Aurelian in the deed, perhaps even signing the warrant for his death
    himself.[25]

    During the reign of Claudius, Aurelian was promoted rapidly: he was given command of the elite Dalmatian cavalry and
    soon promoted to overall head of the army after the emperor and what had been Emperor Claudius' own position before
    his acclamation.[25] The war against Aureolus and the concentration of forces in Italy allowed the Alamanni to break
    through the Rhaetian limes along the upper Danube. Marching through Raetia and the Alps unhindered, they entered
    northern Italy and began pillaging the area. In early 269, emperor Claudius and Aurelian marched north to meet the
    Alamanni, defeating them at the Battle of Lake Benacus.[26]

    While still dealing with the defeated enemy, news came from the Balkans reporting large-scale attacks from the
    Heruli, Goths, Gepids, and Bastarnae.[26] Claudius immediately dispatched Aurelian to the Balkans to contain the
    invasion as best he could until Claudius could arrive with his main army.[27] The Goths were besieging Thessalonica
    when they heard of emperor Claudius' approach, causing them to abandon the siege and pillage north-eastern
    Macedonia. Aurelian intercepted the Goths with his Dalmatian cavalry and defeated them in a series of minor
    skirmishes, killing as many as three thousand of the enemy. Aurelian continued to harass the enemy, driving them
    northward into Upper Moesia where emperor Claudius had assembled his main army. The ensuing battle was indecisive:
    the northward advance of the Goths was halted but Roman losses were heavy.[27]

    Claudius could not afford another pitched battle, so he instead laid a successful ambush, killing thousands.
    However, the majority of the Goths escaped and began retreating south the way they had come. For the rest of year,
    Aurelian harassed the enemy with his Dalmatian cavalry.[28]


    Ruins of Imperial Palace at Sirmium, today in Sremska Mitrovica
    Now stranded in Roman territory, the Goths' lack of provisions began to take its toll. Aurelian, sensing his
    enemies' desperation, attacked them with the full force of his cavalry, killing many and driving the remainder
    westward into Thrace.[28] As winter set in, the Goths retreated into the Haemus Mountains, only to find themselves
    trapped and surrounded. The harsh conditions now exacerbated their shortage of food. However, the Romans
    underestimated the Goths and let their guard down, allowing the enemy to break through their lines and escape.
    Apparently emperor Claudius ignored advice, perhaps from Aurelian, and withheld the cavalry and sent in only the
    infantry to stop their break-out.

    The determined Goths killed many of the oncoming infantry and were only prevented from slaughtering them all when
    Aurelian finally charged in with his Dalmatian cavalry. The Goths still managed to escape and continued their march
    through Thrace.[28] The Roman army continued to follow the Goths during the spring and summer of 270. Meanwhile, a
    devastating plague swept through the Balkans, killing many soldiers in both armies.

    Emperor Claudius fell ill on the march to the battle and returned to his regional headquarters in Sirmium, leaving
    Aurelian in charge of operations against the Goths.[28] Aurelian used his cavalry to great effect, breaking the
    Goths into smaller groups which were easier to handle. By late summer the Goths were defeated: any survivors were
    stripped of their animals and booty and were levied into the army or settled as farmers in frontier regions.[28]
    Aurelian had no time to relish his victories; in late August news arrived from Sirmium that emperor Claudius was
    dead</p>

  <h2 id="asEmperor">As Emperor</h2>

  <h3 id="riseToPower">Rise to power</h3>
  <p>When Claudius died, his brother Quintillus seized power with support of the Senate. With an act typical of the
    Crisis of the Third Century, the army refused to recognize the new emperor, preferring to support one of its own
    commanders: Aurelian was proclaimed emperor about May 270[30][31] by the legions in Sirmium. Aurelian defeated
    Quintillus' troops, and was recognized as emperor by the Senate after Quintillus' death. The claim that Aurelian was
    chosen by Claudius on his death bed[32] can be dismissed as propaganda; later, probably in 272, Aurelian put his own
    dies imperii at the day of Claudius' death, thus implicitly considering Quintillus a usurper.[33]

    With his base of power secure, he now turned his attention to Rome's greatest problems – recovering the vast
    territories lost over the previous two decades, and reforming the res publica.</p>

  <h3 id="The-Roman-Empire-in-the-270s">The Roman Empire in the 270s</h3>
  <p>In 248, Emperor Philip the Arab had celebrated the millennium of the city of Rome with great and expensive
    ceremonies and games, and the Empire had given a tremendous proof of self-confidence.[34] In the following years,
    however, the Empire had to face a huge pressure from external enemies, while, at the same time, dangerous civil wars
    threatened the empire from within, with usurpers weakening the strength of the state. Also, the economic substrate
    of the state, agriculture and commerce, suffered from the disruption caused by the instability. On top of this an
    epidemic swept through the Empire around 250, greatly diminishing manpower[35] both for the army and for
    agriculture.

    The end result was that the Empire could not endure the blow of the capture of Emperor Valerian in 260 by the
    Sassanids. The eastern provinces found their protectors in the rulers of the city of Palmyra, in Syria, whose
    autonomy grew until the formation of the Palmyrene Empire, which was successful in defending against the Sassanid
    threat. The western provinces, those facing the limes of the Rhine, seceded to form a third, autonomous state within
    the territories of the Roman Empire, which is now known as the Gallic Empire.

    In Rome, the Emperor was occupied with internal menaces to his power and with the defence of Italia and the Balkans.
  </p>


  <h3 id="Reunification of the empire">Reunification of the empire</h3>
  <p>The first actions of the new Emperor were aimed at strengthening his own position in his territories. Late in 270,
    Aurelian campaigned in northern Italia against the Vandals, Juthungi, and Sarmatians, expelling them from Roman
    territory. To celebrate these victories, Aurelian was granted the title of Germanicus Maximus.[36] The authority of
    the Emperor was challenged by several usurpers—Septimius, Urbanus, Domitianus, and the rebellion of Felicissimus—who
    tried to exploit the sense of insecurity of the empire and the overwhelming influence of the armies in Roman
    politics. Aurelian, being an experienced commander, was aware of the importance of the army, and his propaganda,
    known through his coinage, shows he wanted the support of the legions.[3</p>


  <h3 id="Defending-Italy-against-the-Juthungi">Defending Italy against the Juthungi</h3>
  <p>The burden of the northern barbarians was not yet over, however. In 271, the Alamanni moved towards Italia,
    entering the Po plain and sacking the villages; they passed the Po River, occupied Placentia and moved towards Fano.
    Aurelian, who was in Pannonia to control the Vandals' withdrawal, quickly entered Italia, but his army was defeated
    in an ambush near Placentia (January 271). When the news of the defeat arrived in Rome, it caused great fear for the
    arrival of the barbarians, but Aurelian attacked the Alamanni camping near the Metaurus River, defeating them in the
    Battle of Fano, and forcing them to re-cross the Po river; Aurelian finally routed them at Pavia. For this, he
    received the title Germanicus Maximus. However, the menace of the Germanic people and a Germanic invasion was still
    perceived by the Romans as likely; therefore Aurelian resolved to build a new system of walls around Rome that
    became known as the Aurelian Walls.[37]</p>


  <h3 id="Defeat of the Goths and abandonment of Dacia">Defeat of the Goths and abandonment of Dacia</h3>
  <p>The emperor led his legions to the Balkans, where he defeated and routed the Goths beyond the Danube, killing the
    Gothic leader Cannabaudes, and assuming the title of Gothicus Maximus. However, he decided to abandon the province
    of Dacia, on the exposed north bank of the Danube, as it was too difficult and expensive to defend. He reorganized a
    new province of Dacia south of the Danube, inside the former Moesia, called Dacia Aureliana, with Serdica as the
    capital</p>


  <h3 id="Conquest-of-the-Palmyrene-Empire">Conquest of the Palmyrene Empire</h3>
  <p>In 272, Aurelian turned his attention to the lost eastern provinces of the empire, the Palmyrene Empire, ruled by
    Queen Zenobia from the city of Palmyra.[39] Zenobia had carved out her own empire, encompassing Syria, Palestine,
    Egypt and large parts of Asia Minor. The Syrian queen cut off Rome's shipments of grain, and in a matter of weeks,
    the Romans started running low on bread. In the beginning, Aurelian had been recognized as Emperor, while
    Vaballathus, the son of Zenobia, held the title of rex and imperator ("king" and "supreme military commander"), but
    Aurelian decided to invade the eastern provinces as soon as he felt his army to be strong enough.

    Asia Minor was recovered easily; every city but Byzantium and Tyana surrendered to him with little resistance. The
    fall of Tyana lent itself to a legend: Aurelian to that point had destroyed every city that resisted him, but he
    spared Tyana after having a vision of the great 1st-century philosopher Apollonius of Tyana, whom he respected
    greatly, in a dream. Apollonius implored: "Aurelian, if you desire to rule, abstain from the blood of the innocent!
    Aurelian, if you will conquer, be merciful!"[40] Aurelian spared Tyana, and it paid off; many more cities submitted
    to him upon seeing that the Emperor would not exact revenge upon them. Within six months, his armies stood at the
    gates of Palmyra, which surrendered when Zenobia tried to flee to the Sassanid Empire. Eventually Zenobia and her
    son were captured and made to walk the streets of Rome in his triumph, the woman in golden chains. With the grain
    stores once again shipped to Rome, Aurelian's soldiers handed out free bread to the citizens of the city, and the
    Emperor was hailed a hero by his subjects. After a brief clash with the Persians and another in Egypt against the
    usurper Firmus, Aurelian was obliged to return to Palmyra in 273 when that city rebelled once more. This time,
    Aurelian allowed his soldiers to sack the city, and Palmyra never recovered. More honors came his way; he was now
    known as Parthicus Maximus and Restitutor Orientis ("Restorer of the East").[33]

    The rich province of Egypt was also recovered by Aurelian. The Brucheion (Royal Quarter) in Alexandria was burned to
    the ground. This section of the city once contained the Library of Alexandria, although the extent of the surviving
    Library in Aurelian's time is uncertain.</p>


  <h3 id="Conquest-of-the-Gallic-Empire">Conquest of the Gallic Empire</h3>
  <p>In 274, the victorious emperor turned his attention to the west, and the Gallic Empire which had already been
    reduced in size by Claudius II. Aurelian won this campaign largely through diplomacy; the "Gallic Emperor" Tetricus
    was willing to abandon his throne and allow Gaul and Britain to return to the Empire, but could not openly submit to
    Aurelian. Instead, the two seem to have conspired so that when the armies met at the Battle of Châlons at
    Durocatalaunum that autumn, Tetricus simply deserted to the Roman camp and Aurelian easily defeated the Gallic army
    facing him.[citation needed] Tetricus was rewarded for his collusion by Aurelian who made him a senator and
    corrector (governor) of Lucania et Bruttium. Aurelian returned to Rome and won his last honorific from the Senate –
    Restitutor Orbis ("Restorer of the World"). This title was first assumed by Aurelian in late summer of 272, and had
    been carried previously by both Valerian and Gallienus.[23] In four years, Aurelian had secured the frontiers of the
    Empire and reunified it</p>


  <h3 id="Reforms">Reforms</h3>
  <p>Aurelian was a reformer, and settled many important functions of the imperial apparatus, dealing with the economy
    and religion. He restored many public buildings, reorganized the management of the food reserves, set fixed prices
    for the most important goods, and prosecuted misconduct by the public officers</p>


  <h3 id="Religious-reform">Religious reform</h3>
  <p>Aurelian strengthened the position of the Sun god Sol Invictus as the main divinity of the Roman pantheon. His
    intention was to give to all the peoples of the Empire, civilian or soldiers, easterners or westerners, a single god
    they could believe in without betraying their own gods. The centre of the cult was a new temple, built in 274 and
    dedicated on December 25[42] of that year in the Campus Agrippae in Rome, with great decorations financed by the
    spoils of the Palmyrene Empire.

    During his short rule, Aurelian seemed to follow the principle of "one faith, one empire", which would not be made
    official until the Edict of Thessalonica. He appears with the title deus et dominus natus ("God and born ruler") on
    some of his coins, a style also later adopted by Diocletian. Lactantius argued that Aurelian would have outlawed all
    the other gods if he had had enough time. He was recorded by Christian historians as having organized persecutions
  </p>


  <h3 id="Felicissimus'-rebellion-and-coinage-reform">Felicissimus' rebellion and coinage reform</h3>
  <p>Aurelian's reign records the only uprising of mint workers. The rationalis Felicissimus, a senior public financial
    official whose responsibilities included supervision of the mint at Rome, revolted against Aurelian. The revolt
    seems to have been caused by the fact that the mint workers, and Felicissimus first, were accustomed to stealing the
    silver for the coins and producing coins of inferior quality. Aurelian wanted to eliminate this, and put
    Felicissimus on trial. The rationalis incited the mint workers to revolt: the rebellion spread in the streets, even
    if it seems that Felicissimus was killed immediately, presumably executed.

    The Palmyrene rebellion in Egypt had probably reduced the grain supply to Rome, thus disaffecting the population to
    the emperor. This rebellion also had the support of some senators, probably those who had supported the election of
    Quintillus, and thus had something to fear from Aurelian.

    Aurelian ordered the cohortes urbanae ("urban cohorts"), reinforced by some regular troops of the imperial army, to
    attack the rebelling mob: the resulting battle, fought on the Caelian hill, marked the end of the revolt, even if at
    a high price (some sources give the figure, probably exaggerated, of 7,000 casualties).[41] Many of the rebels were
    executed; also some of the supporting senators were put to death. The mint of Rome was closed temporarily, and the
    institution of several other mints caused the main mint of the empire to lose its hegemony.[47]

    His monetary reformation included the introduction of antoniniani containing 5% silver. They bore the mark XXI (or
    its Greek numeral form KA), which meant that twenty of such coins would contain the same silver quantity of an old
    silver denarius.[48][e] Considering that this was an improvement over the previous situation gives an idea of the
    severity of the economic situation Aurelian faced. The Emperor struggled to introduce the new "good" coin by
    recalling all the old "bad" coins before their introduction.[33]

    A very large number of rare gold coins of Aurelian have been discovered as part of the Lava Treasure in Corsica,
    France, in the 1980s</p>


  <h3 id="Food-distribution-reforms">Food distribution reforms</h3>
  <p>Rome had been distributing grain to its poorest citizens at a reduced price since 123 BC, and for free since 58 BC
    through the Cura Annonae. Aurelian is usually credited with changing or completing the change of the food
    distribution system from grain or flour to bread, and adding olive oil, salt, and pork to the products distributed
    to the populace. These products had been distributed sporadically before. Aurelian is also credited with increasing
    the size of the loaves of bread without increasing their price – a measure that was undoubtedly popular with the
    Romans who were not receiving free bread and other products through the dole.[50]

    Aurelian is believed to have terminated Trajan's alimenta program. Roman prefect Titus Flavius Postumius Quietus was
    the last known official in charge of the alimenta, in 271. If Aurelian "did suppress this food distribution system,
    he most likely intended to put into effect a more radical reform." Indeed, around this time, Aurelian reformed the
    Cura Annonae to replace the dole of grain by a dole of bread, salt and pork, as well as subsidized prices for other
    goods such as oil and wine</p>


  <h3 id="Death">Death</h3>
  <p>The deaths of the Sassanid Kings Shapur I (272) and Hormizd I (273) in quick succession, and the rise to power of a
    weakened ruler (Bahram I), presented an opportunity to attack the Sassanid Empire, and in 275 Aurelian set out for
    another campaign against the Sassanids. On his way, he suppressed a revolt in Gaul – possibly against Faustinus, an
    officer or usurper of Tetricus – and defeated barbarian marauders in Vindelicia (Germany).

    However, Aurelian never reached Persia, as he was murdered while waiting in Thrace to cross into Asia Minor. As an
    administrator, he had been strict and had handed out severe punishments to corrupt officials or soldiers. A
    secretary of his (called Eros by Zosimus) had told a lie on a minor issue. In fear of what the emperor might do, he
    forged a document listing the names of high officials marked by the emperor for execution and showed it to
    collaborators. The notarius Mucapor and other high-ranking officers of the Praetorian Guard, fearing punishment from
    the emperor, murdered him in late September or early October 275, in Caenophrurium, Thrace.[52]

    Aurelian's enemies in the Senate briefly succeeded in passing damnatio memoriae on the emperor, but this was
    reversed before the end of the year, and Aurelian, like his predecessor Claudius II, was deified as Divus
    Aurelianus.

    There is some evidence that Aurelian's wife, Ulpia Severina, who had been declared Augusta in 274, ruled the empire
    in her own right for some time after his death, although this is just speculative.[53][24] Sources hint at an
    interregnum between Aurelian's death and the election of Marcus Claudius Tacitus as his successor. Additionally,
    some of Ulpia's coins appear to have been minted after Aurelian's death</p>
